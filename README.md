Library Frontend (Angular 17 + Angular Material)
-----------------------------------------------

This is a generated skeleton for the frontend application to consume the Library Management API.

How to run:

   npm install

2. Run the app:
   npm start
   The app will open at http://localhost:4200

Notes:
- Angular Material is included in package.json; run `ng add @angular/material` after installing to configure themes properly.
